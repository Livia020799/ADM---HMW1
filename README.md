ADM - Homework1

NOTES:
1) I don't know why but when I accessed the submitted exercises codes, almost all of them weren't saved even though I already submitted them succesfully days ago, so I had to re-submit them from the .py file I attached to this GutHub repository

2) I forgot to get the website addresses that I consulted, I visited:
   Geeks for geeks
   Stackoverflow
   Python functions documentations

Also, during this assignment, I learned to use the * operator (to extract elements from lists,arrays, matrices and so on...) - which I find very useful and is why a lot of my fronts have that operator- and to write some specific functions that do specific tasks
